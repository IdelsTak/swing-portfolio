# Java Swing GUI Portfolio

A showcase of projects created using Java Swing

## Emissions Tracker

The application calculates the CO<sup>2</sup> emissions  of every day activities like commuting and food consumption.

I created it to serve two locales, English- and German-speaking.

The applications uses the [Nimbus](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/swing/nimbus_laf.html) Swing theme.

See a some screen-shots below.
